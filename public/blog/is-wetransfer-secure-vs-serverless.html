      <h1>Is WeTransfer Secure? Why Serverless Transfer is Safer</h1>
      <p class="article-meta">Updated January 2025 · 5 min read</p>

      <div class="summary-box">
        <h3>The 30-Second Answer</h3>
        <p><strong>What's the most secure way to send sensitive documents?</strong> Ensure it's never stored on a third-party server. While services like WeTransfer use strong encryption, they store your file on their servers. If that server is hacked, or if an employee goes rogue, your data is at risk.</p>
        <p><strong>Serverless P2P tools</strong> are safer for sensitive data because the file is <strong>ephemeral</strong> — it streams directly between computers and is never saved anywhere in between. There's simply nothing for a hacker to steal.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>The "Mailbox" Analogy</h2>
      <p>To understand the difference between cloud transfer and serverless transfer, imagine sending a secret letter to a friend.</p>

      <div class="pros-cons">
        <div class="cons">
          <h3>Cloud Transfer (The Mailbox)</h3>
          <p>Using WeTransfer or Google Drive is like putting your letter in a <strong>locked mailbox</strong> on a street corner:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your friend can pick it up later (convenient)</li>
            <li>But the letter sits there for days</li>
            <li>The mail service has a master key</li>
            <li>If a thief breaks in, they steal your letter</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="pros">
          <h3>Serverless Transfer (The Handshake)</h3>
          <p>Using P2P is like walking up to your friend and <strong>handing them the letter directly</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>There's no mailbox</li>
            <li>There's no mailman</li>
            <li>Once handed over, no copy exists anywhere else</li>
            <li>Nothing to intercept or steal</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>In tech terms, cloud services use <strong>"Storage"</strong> — even if encrypted, data exists on a disk owned by a corporation. It can be subpoenaed, leaked in a breach, or accessed by compromised credentials.</p>
      <p>Serverless transfer is <strong>"Ephemeral"</strong> — data exists only in RAM during transfer. Once complete, it vanishes from the internet entirely.</p>

      <h2>The Tech: "Encrypted at Rest" vs. "No Rest"</h2>

      <div class="highlight-box">
        <h3>WeTransfer: Encrypted at Rest</h3>
        <p>Standard services scramble your file on their hard drives. However, they hold the keys to unscramble it (to generate download links). If their key management is compromised, your data is vulnerable.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="highlight-box">
        <h3>KALSU: No Rest (End-to-End)</h3>
        <p>P2P uses <strong>WebRTC</strong> technology. Encryption keys are generated on <em>your</em> browser and shared only with <em>your recipient's</em> browser.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No Middleman:</strong> Servers only help computers find each other (signaling). They never see file data.</li>
          <li><strong>No Storage:</strong> Since files stream instantly, there's no database to hack. You can't leak what you don't have.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2>Pros and Cons: Is Serverless Right for You?</h2>
      <p>Security always comes with trade-offs. Here's the honest breakdown.</p>

      <div class="pros-cons">
        <div class="pros">
          <h3>✓ Pros of Serverless</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Zero Data Footprint:</strong> Ideal for NDAs, legal docs, medical records, financial data</li>
            <li><strong>Hack-Proof:</strong> No database of files means nothing to steal</li>
            <li><strong>GDPR Friendly:</strong> No stored user data simplifies compliance</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="cons">
          <h3>✗ Trade-offs</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>No Undo:</strong> Can't delete a link after sending to wrong person</li>
            <li><strong>No Audit Logs:</strong> Designed for privacy, not corporate surveillance</li>
            <li><strong>Coordination Required:</strong> Both parties must be online simultaneously</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>The Verdict</h2>
      <p><strong>Use cloud services (WeTransfer/Dropbox) if:</strong> You're sending vacation photos, marketing assets, or non-sensitive data where convenience matters more than security. You want recipients to download next week.</p>
      <p><strong>Use serverless P2P if:</strong> You're sending <strong>password files, contracts, tax returns, or proprietary code</strong>. If the file would ruin your day if leaked, skip the cloud. Hand it over directly.</p>

      <div class="cta-box">
        <h3>Send Your Secrets Safely</h3>
        <p>Don't leave your data in a mailbox. Hand it off securely.</p>
